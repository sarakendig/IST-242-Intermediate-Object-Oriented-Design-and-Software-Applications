 * A <i>splittable list</i> is a variant of a normal list that that is
 * split into two lists: a left list and a right list.
 * <p>
 * The data structure uses the notion of a "handle" to specify insertion and
 * deletion sites for entries stored in each side of the list. The handle sits
 * between the left and right lists (see asg instructions for illustration).
 * <ul>
 *     <li>additions can be made to the list (start of right side) by calling
 *     {@link #addToRightAtFront(T)};</li>
 *     <li>removals can be made only by calling
 *     {@link #removeFromRightAtFront()} (right list cannot be empty)</li>
